TODO:
-----

Format the code
Change the style - no capital names, meaningful variable names
Indent the code - 2 spaces instead of a TAB
Try to unify the Harness and Regression
Avoid using member fields where local variables or method parameters are needed
Add Config phase and Config objects
Add Persistor abstraction
Add Logger abstraction
Change the encoding to UTF-8
Generate the files that contain old results into a subdir `tmp`, not a top-level directory
Remove the `bin` directory from the repository
Add other stuff from your notes here


DONE:
-----

introduce a new harness based on JVMTI - measure # times a method has been invoked (for a start)
check if regression detection works for time based tests
transition to sbt
